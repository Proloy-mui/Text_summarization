# 📝 Text Summarization using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to generate concise summaries of large text documents while retaining the essential meaning and information.

## 📌 Overview

The model processes long-form text data and outputs shorter versions using extractive or abstractive summarization methods. Techniques like TF-IDF, sequence-to-sequence models, or transformers (e.g., BART, T5) can be used.

## 🧠 Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- Extractive and/or Abstractive summarization
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics visualization

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Scikit-learn / Transformers (Hugging Face)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- ROUGE Score
- BLEU Score
- Human readability (optional)
